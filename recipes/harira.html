    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Harira</strong> is a hearty and nourishing soup, often served to break the fast during Ramadan but enjoyed year-round across <em>Morocco and neighboring countries.</em> It's a rich tomato-based soup made with a mix of legumes, meat (usually lamb or beef), herbs, and warming spices. The flavors develop into a savory, slightly tangy broth thickened with flour or a flour-water mixture called tedouira. The soup is often finished with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon juice, giving it a bright, comforting taste.</p>
    <p>What makes Harira unique is its blend of ingredients that combine to make it both a filling and flavorful dish. Lentils and chickpeas provide depth and texture, while vermicelli or rice adds body. The aromatic base includes cilantro, parsley, celery, and onion, all finely chopped to infuse the broth. Spices like turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, and black pepper bring warmth and depth. It's commonly served with dates, hard-boiled eggs, or traditional Moroccan pastries like chebakia.</p>
