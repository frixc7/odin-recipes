    <h2 class="headlines tajine">Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Tajine</strong> is a traditional <em>North African</em> stew named after the unique clay pot in which it's cooked. The dish is known for its slow-cooked, deeply flavorful combinations of meat, vegetables, and aromatic spices. One of the most popular versions is chicken with preserved lemon and olives, where the chicken becomes tender and infused with the citrusy, briny flavor. The use of spices like saffron, ginger, turmeric, and cumin gives tajine its rich, warm character. While meat options vary (lamb, beef, or even fish), the cooking process remains slow and gentle, allowing all the flavors to meld together.</p>
    <p>The beauty of tajine lies in its versatility and depth. The ingredients are typically layered in the pot, starting with onions and spices, followed by the meat, and then topped with vegetables, olives, and sometimes dried fruits like apricots or prunes for a sweet-savory combo. The conical lid of the tajine traps steam and circulates it, keeping the dish moist and flavorful. Traditionally, tajine is served with crusty bread to scoop up the rich sauce, making it a comforting and satisfying communal meal.</p>
