    <h2 class="headlines bourak">Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Bourak</strong>, a savory pastry dish popular in <em>North African and Middle Eastern cuisines—especially in Algeria—</em>is typically prepared with thin pastry sheets known as dioul or warka, similar to phyllo dough. The most common filling includes a seasoned mixture of ground beef or lamb, finely chopped onions, garlic, parsley, and sometimes mashed potatoes or beaten egg to bind the mixture. The spices vary by region and personal taste but often include black pepper, paprika, and cumin. This filling is spooned onto the pastry sheets, which are then rolled or folded into cylindrical or triangular shapes.</p>
    <p>Once shaped, the bourak is traditionally deep-fried until golden and crispy, though oven-baked versions are also popular for a lighter option. The result is a crunchy outer shell with a flavorful, juicy interior. Bourak is often served as a starter during Ramadan, alongside a bowl of chorba (a light soup), or as a tasty snack throughout the year. Its crisp texture and warm, spiced filling make it a comforting and crowd-pleasing dish.</p>
